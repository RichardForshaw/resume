Scrum Misconseptions



 - Product Owner: Make sense of the Product's value in the face of complexity, and reduce Decision Latency
 - Scrum Master: Focus on helping the team go faster by reducing Decision Latency and encouraging feedback and acting on it
 - Sprint: Get increments of value to the market quickly, so allowing feedback to the Product Owner
 - Sprint Review: Fast product feedback from the Product Owner and Stakeholders to the team
 - Retrospective: Fast performance feedback from the team to the Scrum Master


Additional Misconceptions:

I believe there is much confusion over the daily scrum, mainly because of the 'three questions' which became a popular way of suggesting how to run the meeting. The Daily Scrum is a feedback session, designed to check if the sprint goal is going to be met or not. The Scrum Guide outlines the Daily Scrum as a meeting to "inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary".


Extra things:
 - Rules should fight for their lives
 - Small teams: transactive memory
 - Don't be dictated to by tools. Cargo-cult scrum.
